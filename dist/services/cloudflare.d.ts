 *   - the body matches the challenge-page fingerprint (≥2 markers), regardless
 *     of status (CF sometimes serves the JS challenge with HTTP 200); or
 *   - the status is a CF bot-block code (403/503) **and** the body also looks
 *     like a challenge page — a bare 403 with a real error body is left alone
 *     so legitimate not-authorised responses are not misclassified.
