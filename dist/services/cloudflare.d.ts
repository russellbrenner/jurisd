 * A response is treated as a challenge when any of these are true:
 *   - Cloudflare sets the documented `cf-mitigated: challenge` response header;
 *   - the body matches the challenge-page fingerprint (≥2 markers), regardless
 *     of status (CF sometimes serves the JS challenge with HTTP 200); or
 *   - the status is a CF bot-block code (403/503) **and** the body also looks
 *     like a challenge page — a bare 403 with a real error body is left alone
 *     so legitimate not-authorised responses are not misclassified.
 *
 * @param status - HTTP status code.
 * @param body - Response body decoded as a UTF-8 string.
 * @param headers - Response headers, used for Cloudflare's documented marker.
