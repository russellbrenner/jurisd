# Contributing to jurisd

Thank you for considering contributing to jurisd! This document provides guidelines for contributing to this project.

## Code of Conduct

Please be respectful and constructive in all interactions. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.18.1 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- Git

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository**

   ```bash
   # Click "Fork" on GitHub, then clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/jurisd.git
   cd jurisd
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the project**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Run tests**

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

5. **Start development mode**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Creating a Branch

Create a descriptive branch name:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

### Making Changes

1. **Write code following the style guide**
   - Use TypeScript strict mode
   - Follow existing code patterns
   - Add JSDoc comments for exported functions

2. **Run linting and formatting**

   ```bash
   npm run lint:fix
   npm run format
   ```

3. **Add tests for new features**
   - Place tests in appropriate directories
   - Follow existing test patterns
   - Ensure tests pass: `npm test`

4. **Build and verify**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
feat: Add pagination support to search results
fix: Correct citation parsing for reported cases
docs: Update README with new examples
test: Add unit tests for citation extraction
```

Prefix types:

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `test:` Adding or updating tests
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

## Development Guidelines

### Command contracts and public surfaces

jurisd has multiple public adapters: MCP, CLI, and future TUI. Do not add or change a public command by editing one adapter only.

Foundation PR 1 is introducing the command contract registry. Once present, add or change public commands through that registry.

For any command-surface change:

1. Preserve MCP compatibility while the registry is being introduced.
2. Update the command contract registry once present.
3. Update or regenerate public help/reference docs.
4. Update `docs/MCP-COMPATIBILITY.md` once present if MCP exposure changes. Before then, update the MCP tool-surface tests.
5. Add or update tests for CLI routing, help, metadata completeness, and MCP compatibility.
6. Document side-effect class, capability gates, and output behaviour.

MCP tools are curated. Operator/install/update/destructive commands remain CLI-only unless a later authority decision explicitly allows MCP exposure.

### Security-sensitive changes

Run an explicit security review for changes involving:

- URLs or source fetching
- local file paths
- credentials or provider keys
- terminal rendering
- shell completions
- MCP tool exposure
- command parsing
- graph/corpus/review mutations

Never commit secrets, `.env` files, provider tokens, cookies, or credential-bearing URLs.

### Code Style

Key principles:

- **TypeScript strict mode**: All code must type-check
- **No `any` types**: Use proper types or `unknown`
- **Error handling**: Wrap network calls in try/catch
- **Primary sources only**: Never return journal articles
- **Preserve citations**: Keep paragraph numbers `[N]` intact

### Testing Requirements

Every PR must include:

- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes (`npm run build`)
- ✅ All tests pass (`npm test`)
- ✅ Linting passes (`npm run lint`)
- ✅ Formatting is correct (`npm run format:check`)
- ✅ New tests for new features
- ✅ Tests validate real behavior (not just mocks)

### Documentation

Update documentation when:

- Adding new features
- Changing public APIs
- Modifying configuration options
- Adding new dependencies

Files to update:

- `README.md` - User-facing documentation
- JSDoc comments - All exported functions

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Update your branch**

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/main
   ```

2. **Run all checks**

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm run format:check
   npm run build
   npm test
   ```

3. **Review your changes**
   ```bash
   git diff origin/main
   ```

### Submitting a PR

1. **Push your branch**

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Create Pull Request on GitHub**
   - Use a clear, descriptive title
   - Reference any related issues
   - Describe what changes were made and why
   - Include examples if adding features

3. **PR Template Checklist**
   - [ ] Tests added/updated
   - [ ] Documentation updated
   - [ ] Code follows style guidelines
   - [ ] All CI checks pass
   - [ ] No breaking changes (or documented if necessary)

### Review Process

- Maintainers will review your PR
- Address feedback in new commits
- Once approved, maintainers will merge

## Types of Contributions

### Bug Reports

**Before submitting:**

- Search existing issues
- Check if it's already fixed in `main`

**Include:**

- Clear description
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment (Node version, OS, etc.)
- Relevant logs or error messages

### Feature Requests

**Before submitting:**

- Search existing issues/discussions for planned or in-flight work

**Include:**

- Clear use case
- Proposed solution
- Why it benefits the project
- Alternatives considered

### Code Contributions

**Good first issues:**

- Look for `good first issue` label
- Start with documentation improvements
- Add tests for existing code
- Fix minor bugs

**Major features:**

- Discuss in an issue first
- Break into smaller PRs when possible

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch
```

### Writing Tests

Place tests in appropriate locations:

- `src/test/unit/` - Unit tests for individual functions
- `src/test/integration/` - Integration tests with live APIs

Example test:

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import { searchAustLii } from "../../services/austlii";

describe("searchAustLii", () => {
  it("should return search results", async () => {
    const results = await searchAustLii("negligence", {
      type: "case",
      limit: 5,
    });

    expect(results).toBeDefined();
    expect(results.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  });
});
```
