/**
 * Self-healing AUSTLII_COOKIE refresh.
 *
 * On AustLII 401/403, run scripts/refresh-austlii-cookie.mjs to decrypt
 * whatever cookies the user's Chrome currently has cached for `.austlii.edu.au`
 * and write them to `.env`. Reload `.env` into `process.env` so the new
 * cookie takes effect immediately and retry the failing request.
 *
 * Works whenever Chrome's stored cookies are fresher than the server's
 * `.env` — the common case, since Chrome rotates cookies in the background
 * as the user browses.
 *
 * If Chrome's stored cookies are also stale (or Cloudflare has flagged the
 * machine's IP and isn't accepting our cookies even when fresh), the retry
 * also 401/403s and we throw {@link AustliiPersistentAuthError}. Recovery
 * is then a manual step: the user opens AustLII in Chrome and runs a search
 * (Cloudflare's challenge fires reliably from a real form submission, less
 * reliably from direct URL navigation). On the next tool call, the server
 * extracts the freshly-issued cookies from Chrome's DB and proceeds normally.
