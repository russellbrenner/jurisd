# jurisd

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Australian legal research, built
**local-first**. jurisd gives an AI assistant a fast, offline-capable recall
layer over installed legal data modules — deterministic provision lookup,
local semantic search, and a citation graph — and falls back to live AustLII
search and an Open Australian Legal Corpus (OALC) layer when the answer is not
in a local module.

The design tenet is **degrade visibly, never silently**: a missing optional
dependency, an absent API key, or an uninstalled module disables only the
feature that needs it and is reported back, never swallowed. With no key and no
network, the local-module recall path still answers.

**Status:** pre-1.0, day-0 release candidate. 15 MCP tools across live research,
citation/bibliography, and local data modules.

## What jurisd is

jurisd answers Australian (and New Zealand) legal-research questions from an AI
assistant. It has three answer sources, tried in precedence order:

1. **Local data modules (Layer 1)** — installed parquet bundles holding
   legislation and decisions with provision-level structure, citation edges, and
   chunk embeddings. Answered offline, no network, no key. This is the
   **local-first** core: deterministic provision lookup, an Act containment tree,
   an offline citation graph, and local semantic search.
2. **Live AustLII (Layer 2)** — natural-language case and legislation search over
   AustLII, with authority-based ranking, paragraph-pinpoint extraction, full-text
   fetch (HTML + PDF with OCR), and AGLC4 citation formatting.
3. **OALC fallback (Layer 3)** — an Open Australian Legal Corpus layer that backs
   the live layer when a direct fetch is blocked.

removed.invalid is supported as an authenticated source for search, full-text fetch, and
the citator when you supply your own session cookie.

## Quick start

### Run with npx (no clone)

```bash
npx -y github:russellbrenner/jurisd
```

`npx` clones the repository, installs dependencies, builds, and launches the
server over stdio in one step.

### Register with Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add jurisd -- npx -y github:russellbrenner/jurisd
```

Or add it to your client config directly:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jurisd": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "github:russellbrenner/jurisd"]
    }
  }
}
```

All environment variables are **optional** — with none set, the live AustLII
layer and the local-module recall layer both work. See
[docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) for the local-clone path, every config option,
and the offline/baseline guarantee.

## Tools

15 tools in three groups. Operation variants are selected via a
`mode` / `op` / `action` / `by` discriminator on the relevant tool (see
[docs/decisions/tool-surface.md](docs/decisions/tool-surface.md)).

### Live research (AustLII + removed.invalid)

| Tool                  | What it does                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `search_cases`        | Natural-language case-law search across all AU/NZ jurisdictions; authority ranking; title/phrase/boolean methods; pagination. |
| `search_legislation`  | Search AU/NZ legislation with the same method/jurisdiction/sort controls.                                                     |
| `fetch_document_text` | Fetch full text from an AustLII or removed.invalid URL (HTML, PDF with OCR fallback, removed.invalid via RPC).                            |

### Citation + bibliography (AGLC4)

| Tool                  | What it does                                                                                                         |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `format_citation`     | Format an AGLC4 citation. `mode`: `full` (default), `short`, `ibid`, `subsequent`, `pinpoint`.                       |
| `resolve_citation`    | Resolve a citation to its source. `mode`: `auto` (default), `validate` (AustLII existence check), `search`.          |
| `source_lookup`         | Look up removed.invalid. `by`: `article_id` (resolve metadata) or `citation` (build a lookup URL).                           |
| `search_citing_cases` | Find cases citing a target via the removed.invalid citator (requires `SESSION_COOKIE`).                                 |
| `cite`                | Write to the local citation cache. `action`: `add` (default) or `refresh_source` (conditional-HEAD freshness check). |
| `bibliography`        | Read the local citation cache (no network). `op`: `get`, `list` (default), `export` (`.bib`), `cited_by`.            |
| `cache_cited_by`      | Fetch a cached citation's citing cases from removed.invalid and store them locally (requires `SESSION_COOKIE`).         |

### Local data modules (offline recall)

These five tools serve installed offline data modules. They require the optional
`@duckdb/node-api` dependency and at least one installed module;
`semantic_search_local` additionally needs `@huggingface/transformers`. Every
answer carries `metadata.source = "local_module"` with the module name, version,
and snapshot date (plus a staleness advisory when the snapshot is old).

| Tool                    | What it does                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `get_provision`         | Deterministic provision lookup (e.g. `s 18` of an Act). No embedding, no ranking; typed not-found so the router can fall through.                      |
| `get_act_structure`     | Containment tree of an Act (Act → Part → Division → section/schedule/clause) over `act_provision` edges, closed-world.                                 |
| `find_citing`           | Offline twin of `search_citing_cases`: documents in installed modules that cite a target, with each citation's provenance span.                        |
| `semantic_search_local` | Vector recall: the query is embedded locally (bge-small, offline, no key) and ranked by cosine over chunk embeddings, with optional facet pre-filters. |
| `list_data_modules`     | Introspect installed modules: coverage, doc/chunk counts, embedding descriptor, load status, snapshot date and staleness.                              |

Full parameter tables for every tool are in
[docs/AGENT-GUIDE.md](docs/AGENT-GUIDE.md); the local-module design is in
[docs/design/data-layer.md](docs/design/data-layer.md).

## Data modules

A **data module** is a self-describing parquet bundle (documents, chunks, edges,
unmatched citations, plus a `manifest.json`) published as a GitHub release asset
on the [`jurisd-data`](https://github.com/russellbrenner/jurisd-data) repository.
Everything needed to load and query a module — schema version, coverage,
embedding descriptor, file hashes, and licence posture — is in its manifest. No
out-of-band config.

Modules are queried in place: DuckDB scans the parquet on disk and never
materialises a whole table into memory, so a host can install many modules
(Commonwealth legislation + per-state + decisions) and stay flat in RSS.

### Installing modules

Modules are **operator-installed via the CLI** (kept off the tool surface so an
LLM never triggers a large download mid-conversation):

```bash
jurisd fetch-module <name> [--version X.Y.Z]   # download + sha256-verify + atomic install
jurisd verify-module <name>                     # re-verify installed files against the manifest
jurisd list-modules                             # list installed modules (incl. refused)
```

The default install root is `~/.jurisd/modules/` (override with
`JURISD_MODULES_DIR` or `--modules-dir`). `fetch-module` validates the manifest
and checks the schema version **before** downloading any parquet, sha256-verifies
every file against the manifest, installs atomically (temp-then-rename, so a
half-written module never appears), and prints the licence attribution lines at
install time.

### Baseline vs domain-specialised variants

A module's identity is `(name, module_version)`. The `module_version` handle
distinguishes a module's **variant** — a **baseline** module is the standard
build (deterministic structure, citation edges, bge-small embeddings); a
**domain-specialised** variant is a build tuned for a particular corpus or task.
Use `list_data_modules` to see the variant, coverage, and embedding descriptor of
each installed module, and pin a specific one with the `module` argument on any
recall tool.

### BYOK provider adapter

`semantic_search_local` has two optional enhancement slots that operate **over
the locally-retrieved top-k results** — they never replace local recall, they
refine it:

- **rerank** — reorder the local top-k by a stronger relevance model.
- **extractive-QA** — return the best answer span within a retrieved chunk.

Both are expressed through one vendor-neutral `DomainAdapter` interface. The
distinction is **capability presence**, framed as **baseline vs
domain-specialised** with a **provider-interpolated display label**:

- **Baseline** (always present): pure local cosine order. No network, no key.
- **Domain-specialised** (slot): selected only if a provider is configured **and
  reachable** via a BYOK key. With `ISAACUS_API_KEY` set and the endpoint
  reachable, the capability probe reports
  `domain_adapter: { label: "Isaacus-enhanced", canRerank: true, canExtractiveQA: true }`
  and responses carry `metadata.enhancement = "Isaacus-enhanced"`.

If the key is unset, or set-but-unreachable, the adapter degrades to baseline and
the tool still returns local cosine results — reported by the probe, never thrown
into a tool result.

## Quality

jurisd's local data layer is built and scored honestly against a gold set. The
[`jurisd-data` gold-set evaluation](https://github.com/russellbrenner/jurisd-data/blob/main/docs/eval/gold-set-report.md)
measures the local enricher (segments, defined terms, citation crossrefs) against
90 Open Australian Legal Corpus / Kanon ILDGS documents, under two parallel
metrics:

- **strict** — the conservative audit metric: every typed prediction unmatched
  within its type is a false positive.
- **aligned** — the decision metric: a strict false positive whose span
  co-locates an _untyped_ gold sub-span at IoU ≥ 0.9 is credited as a granularity
  agreement (a vocabulary disagreement with the silver standard, not an extraction
  error) rather than penalised.

The current baseline **does not yet pass all four gate thresholds** (segment F1,
citation precision, citation recall, defined-term F1). Headline segment F1 is
0.44 strict / 0.64 aligned against a 0.85 gate. The report localises every gap
to a specific rule (the residual segment gap is genuine over-segmentation, chiefly
an endnotes-boundary flood; citation precision is internal-ref over-firing on
structural lines). It is published in full, both metrics, as the honest current
state, not a marketing number.

## Licensing

- **Code:** MIT (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)). Third-party dependency licences are
  catalogued in [LICENSE-THIRD-PARTY.md](LICENSE-THIRD-PARTY.md).
- **Module data:** licensed **per source**, declared in each module's
  `manifest.json` `licence` block, and surfaced at `fetch-module` install time.
  The aggregate is CC-BY-4.0 (Open Australian Legal Corpus), but redistribution is
  decided per source, not in aggregate:
  - **AustLII-sourced rows are excluded from published modules by default** — the
    AustLII Terms of Service is restrictive, and re-importing it is exactly what
    the live transport layer routes around. They remain available **recipe-only**
    (rebuild locally).
  - **VIC** and **NT** legislation are **not redistributable** (Government Printer
    / Crown copyright, no open licence) — **recipe-only**.
  - Commonwealth (FRL), NSW, QLD, SA, TAS, WA legislation and HCA/FCA/NSW
    case-law sources are redistributable under the CC-BY-4.0 aggregate, subject to
    per-source confirmation before each module publishes.
